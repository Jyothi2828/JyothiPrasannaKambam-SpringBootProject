# DAO Integration Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the DAO integration process in the project.

1. **Project Structure**: Organized into packages for repositories, services, controllers, and models.

2. **DAO Layer**: 
   - `ProductDao` defines CRUD operations.
   - `ProductDaoImpl` implements these methods using `ProductRepository`.

3. **Service Layer**: 
   - `ProductService` uses `ProductDao` for business logic and validation.

4. **Configuration**: 
   - Database connection details in `application.properties` and dependencies in `pom.xml`.

5. **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions manage errors related to product operations.

6. **Testing**: Includes tests to validate DAO functionality and service interactions.
